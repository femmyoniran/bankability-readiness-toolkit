    <h1>About This Toolkit</h1>

<div class="content-section">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The Bankability Assessment Toolkit is designed to help energy infrastructure
        developers, utilities, and financial advisors evaluate the financing readiness
        of grid-scale energy projects. It addresses the persistent capital gap facing
        rural and underserved utilities by providing structured analysis tools aligned
        with federal financing programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Assessment Methodology</h2>
    <p>
        The bankability score is a weighted composite of five assessment dimensions,
        each scored on a 0-100 scale:
